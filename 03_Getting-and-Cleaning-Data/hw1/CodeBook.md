## About this codebook
This CodeBook.md describes all the variables in the tidy dataset (tidy.txt) generated by the R script run_analysis.R.
The original dataset (UCI HAR Dataset) can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## How the tidy dataset is obtained
Originally, there are 561 variables in the dataset (both X_train and X_test). The course instructions require us to "extracts only the measurements on the **mean** and **standard deviation** for each measurement".

So by the regular expression **"-mean[(][)]|-std[(][])]"** used with grep() in R, the program extracts 66 variables.

Finally, the instructions say "Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject". So the program GROUPS the rows BY all the 6 activities x 30 subjects = 180 combinations (180 rows). Then for each group, transform all the remaining measurement variables into the average (mean) values within that group using aggregate().

Therefore, in the tidy dataset, the first 2 variables are *activity* and *subject*, followed by the 66 *measurement variables* in average values for each of the {activity, subject} combinations.
