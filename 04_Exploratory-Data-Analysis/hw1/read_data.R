## File: read_data.R
## Input: NONE
## Output: subset of the dataset from dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02
## Description: 
##   [1] Read and subset the dataset to be 2880 rows and 9 columns.
##   This script is called by plot*.R.
##   Please make sure the filename variable is set correctly.

read_data <- function() {
    filename <- "household_power_consumption.txt"
    # Even though nrows = 1, I'll only use the header (names)
    header <- read.table(filename, header = T, sep = ";", nrows = 1)
    # Specifying colClasses will save memory
    colClasses <- c(rep("character", 2), rep("numeric", 7))
    
    ## I have noticed several ways of reading and subsetting the data from
    ## the course forum in July, 2014. I will try to implement all of them.

    ## [method 1, cheating] Count the EXACT number of rows to skip and to read: 0.59 sec
    # This is not smart, but I list it as method 1 for the sake of easy grading:
    #   a. It has the least platform compatibility issues.
    #   b. It does not require additional packages.
    #   c. It runs very fast.
    # But you are encouraged to try other methods if you are interested.
    dat <- read.table(filename, header = F, sep = ";", colClasses = colClasses, na.strings = "?", skip = 66637, nrows = 2880)
    names(dat) <- names(header)
    
    ## [method 2] pipe + UNIX grep (This may fail on Windows!!): 2.35 sec
    # I have skipped converting the NA symbols since there aren't any in the subset.
#     conn <- pipe(paste("grep ^[1-2]/2/2007 ", filename))
#     dat <- read.table(conn, header = F, sep = ";", colClasses = colClasses, na.strings = "?")
#     # The connection is closed automatically after read.table(), so we shouldn't
#     # manually call close(conn).
#     names(dat) <- names(header)
    
    ## [method 3] read.csv.sql() in {sqldf} package: 36 sec (VERY SLOW on Mac!!!)
    # I have skipped converting the NA symbols since there aren't any in the subset.
#     library(sqldf)
#     dat <- read.csv2.sql(filename, "SELECT * FROM file WHERE Date = '1/2/2007' OR Date = '2/2/2007'")

    ## [for reference] normal read.table: 23 sec
#     dat <- read.table(filename, header = T, sep = ";", colClasses = colClasses, na.strings = "?")

    # Finally, convert the Date and Time variables to corresponding R classes
    dat$Time <- strptime(paste(dat$Date, dat$Time), "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
    dat$Date <- as.Date(dat$Date, "%d/%m/%Y")
    
    # Return the subset from dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02
    dat
